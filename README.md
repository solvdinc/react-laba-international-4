# Solvd React Laba International 2025

This repository contains all information about the lectures, workshops and other useful information
for course.

## Structure

Please create a new repository for your homework submissions. Inside this repository, there should
be a folder named `homeworks`. The Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.

## Pull Requests

### Naming

Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for
a developer Mykhailo Melnyk prefix would be `mm-`. In case of prefix collisions in the future the
common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: `mmel-`. Pattern for branch should be
`mmel-{lecture_number}-{letcture_name}`. For example, `mmel-01-basics`.

### Pattern

So, for each homework, you will need to create a Pull Request and use this pattern for the
naming -**[Homework #{number}]** - **{Lecture Name}** by **{Name Surname}**

For example **[Homework #3] - HTML by Vitalii Melnyk**

### Reviews

Once PR is created you have to do the following things:

- Assign your mentor as a reviewer
- Ping the mentor about the PR ;)

### Inviting Mentors

Don't forget to invite your mentor(s) to your repository so they can access and review your work.
You can invite them by going to your repository settings and adding them as collaborators.

# FAQ

Here you can find some useful information about our Laba processes. And you can always ask us!

<details>
<summary>What is the deadline for homework?</summary>

The deadline for all homework assignments is the next lecture, unless otherwise changed by your
mentor.

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>What are the requirements to successfully pass the exam?</summary>

Your exam result depends on whether you've submitted all assignments during the block, as well as
your performance in the theoretical and practical parts of the exam. Based on your results, a
decision will be made on whether you proceed to the next stage.

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>What should I do if I was moved to a different group during the lab?</summary>

Sometimes we need to rebalance groups after the exams. If you were moved to a different group after
a block, it means you were assigned to a different mentor's group. If you have any additional
questions, feel free to reach out to any of the mentors â€” weâ€™re always happy to help!
